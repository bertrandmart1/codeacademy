/*Fizz Buzz is a classic developer interview question that is asked or referred to so often for so long, it is almost a clich√©!
 Though this challenge will appear very simplistic to those with some coding experience, it is designed to weed out 99.5% of
 programming job candidates who cannot creatively use their coding knowledge to solve simple problems.
Want to give it a shot?
Write a fizzbuzz.c program that outputs numbers from 1 to 100.
But for multiples of 3, print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of 5, print Buzz. 
For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print FizzBuzz. */

#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
  int i;
  for(i = 1; i <= 100; i++){
    if((i % 3 == 0) && (i % 5 == 0)){
      printf("BuzzFizz\n");
    } else if(i % 3 == 0){
      printf("Buzz\n");
    } else if(i % 5 == 0){
      printf("Fizz\n");
    } else
    printf("%d\n", i);
} 
}
